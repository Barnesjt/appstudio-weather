# Weather (AppStudio)

This application gives the current weather (current temperature, and daily high/low) based on the device location. Additionally it provides a 7 day (including the current) forecast of highs and lows. The map pin icon can be clicked to show the current device location on a map.

The weather information is queried from https://open-meteo.com/en, and cached locally in case of network interruption in an sqlite database.

Screenshot shown below (coordinates have been intentionally removed):

Screenshot of map below (map does zoom to location on load, but I didn't want to quite pinpoint myself..) :
